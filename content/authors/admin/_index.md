As an alumnus of the University of Edinburgh, with a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I completed a year of rigorous study at the institution. And I had re-applied to National University of Singapore (NUS) to pursue  further studies in Electrical Engineering.

Presently, my research interests revolve around optimization techniques, Bayesian clustering methodologies, and the domain of smart grids. I was working with prof. [Xiang Cheng](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/xiang-cheng/), and I am deeply invested in exploring these areas to contribute valuable insights to the field.

Having engaged in previous research endeavors, I have actively worked on dynamic pricing models for airline tickets, smart grid optimization, and clustering problems. These experiences have honed my analytical abilities and fortified my passion for academic exploration.

I am eagerly seeking opportunities in research in system engineering and management consulting. Thank you and welcome to my page!
