As an alumnus of the prestigious University of Edinburgh, with a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I completed a year of rigorous study at the institution. In response to the challenges posed by the COVID pandemic, I have taken the initiative to re-apply to the National University of Singapore (NUS) to pursue further studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering.\

During my academic tenure, my coursework encompassed a comprehensive range of EE-related subjects, including theoretical mathematics, applied mathematics, signals and systems, circuit analysis, and energy electronics. Additionally, I delved into system engineering topics, such as system dynamics, time series, and machine learning, among others.\

My skill set comprises proficiency in Arduino, Python, C++, MATLAB, Stella Architect (a system dynamics simulation tool), SolidWorks, and diverse applications of machine learning within environmental contexts.\

Presently, my research interests revolve around optimization techniques, Bayesian clustering methodologies, and the domain of smart grids. I am deeply invested in exploring these areas to contribute valuable insights to the field.\

Having engaged in previous research endeavors, I have actively worked on dynamic pricing models for airline tickets, smart grid optimization, and clustering problems. These experiences have honed my analytical abilities and fortified my passion for academic exploration.\

I am eagerly seeking opportunities in research and consulting roles, and I am equally enthusiastic about pursuing positions in product management.\
