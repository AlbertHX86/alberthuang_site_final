As an alumini of the University of Edinburgh, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I had been studied there for a year. Due to the COVID pandemic, I have reapplied to NUS for Electrical and Computer Engineering.\
My course content covered EE-related content such as theoretical mathematics, applied mathematics, signals and systems, circuit analysis, energy electronics, etc.\
It also covered systems engineering-related content such as system dynamics, time series, machine learning, etc.\
My skills include Arduino, Python, C++, MATLAB, Stella Architect (system dynamics simulation), SolidWorks, and various environmental applications for machine learning.\
My current research interests focus on optimisation, Bayesian clustering, smart grids, etc. Previous research projects include dynamic pricing models for airline tickets, smart grid optimisation and clustering problems.\
Looking forward to research opportunities and positions in consulting and product management!
