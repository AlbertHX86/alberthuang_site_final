Clustering algorithms are powerful unsupervised machine learning techniques used to group similar data points together based on their attributes and features. Clustering algorithms also have many application scenarios, such as the rise in popularity of electric vehicles and smart grids, where the utilization patterns of electric vehicle users in smart grids and consumer behaviour become topics that need to be enhanced in pricing models. In order to classify user behaviour, clustering can be applied to the raw charging data to find the charging behaviour of different users.

In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between two widely-used clustering algorithms, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and K-means, in terms of their accuracy, time and space complexity, and suitability for various application scenarios. Specifically, we evaluate the accuracy of both algorithms using two well-established metrics, the Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) and Error Rate, to provide a quantitative assessment of their performance. Our analysis further investigates the time and space complexity of GMM and K-means, offering insights into their efficiency and scalability.

To demonstrate the practical implications of these algorithms, we applied both GMM and K- means to a real-world dataset of electric vehicle (EV) charging data from the Colorado Boulder workspace. Our objective was to uncover hidden trends, identify peak charging hours, and analyze customersâ€™ behaviours. The results from both algorithms provide valuable insights into the charging patterns and user preferences, with each method highlighting specific aspects of the data.
